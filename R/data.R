#' Raw consistency test data example, wide format (small)
#'
#' A data frame with an example of raw consistency test data that are
#' compatible with the synr package's `create_participantgroup_widedata_widedata` function,
#' with data for three participants from a test that included three
#' graphemes ("A", "D", 7) and two responses
#' per grapheme. More graphemes and/or
#' responses per grapheme can be handled by the package (though participant
#' plots do not function correctly if there are more than three responses
#' per grapheme)

#' @format A data frame with 3 rows and 8 columns:

#' Raw consistency test data example, long format (small)
#'
#' A data frame with an example of raw consistency test data that are
#' compatible with the synr package's `create_participantgroup_widedata` function,
#' with data for three participants from a test that included three
#' graphemes ("A", "D", 7) and two responses
#' per grapheme. More graphemes and/or
#' responses per grapheme can be handled by the package (though participant
#' plots do not function correctly if there are more than three responses
#' per grapheme). Note that response times are optional. If you don't have
#' them, you can still use synr - see `help(create_participantgroup_widedata)`.

#' Raw consistency test data example (full)
#'
#' A data frame with an example of raw consistency test data that are
#' compatible with the synr package, with data for ten participants
#' from a test that used English letters and weekdays, and digits. Has three responses
#' per grapheme. More graphemes and/or
#' responses per grapheme can be handled by the package (though participant
#' plots do not function correctly if there are more than three responses
#' per grapheme, and too many graphemes might make the plots look odd)
#'
#' @format A data frame with 10 rows and 389 columns. The
#' first two columns are participant id and time/date of testing.
#' The remaining columns describe trial data, with each trial
#' represented by a set of 3 columns. The 3 columsn represent
#' the symbol (grapheme) used, response time, and the color code that
#' the participant responded with.
