    Checks if participants' data are valid based on passed arguments.
    This method aims to identify participants who had too few responses or
    varied their response colors too little, by marking them as invalid.
    Note that there are no absolutely correct values, as what is 'too little
    variation' is highly subjective. You might need to tweak parameters to be
    in line with your project's criteria, especially if you use another color
    space than CIELUV, since the default values are based on what seems
    to make sense in a CIELUV context. If you use the results in a
    research article, make sure to reference synr and specify what parameter
    values you passed to the function.

    This method relies heavily on the DBSCAN algorithm and the package
    'dbscan', and involves calculating a synr-specific 'Total Within-Cluster
    Variance' (TWCV) score. You can find more information, and
    what the parameters here mean, in
    the documentation for the function \\code{validate_get_twcv}. Note
    that DBSCAN clustering and related calculations are performed on
    a per-participant basis, before they are summarized in the data frame
    returned by this method.
    \\subsection{Parameters}{
      \\itemize{
        \\item{\\code{min_complete_graphemes} The minimum number of graphemes
          with complete (all non-NA color) responses that a participant's data
          must have for them to not be categorized as invalid based on
          this criterion. Defaults to 7.
        }
        \\item{\\code{dbscan_eps} Radius of 'epsilon neighborhood' when applying
          (on a per-participant basis) DBSCAN clustering. Defaults to 30.
        }
        \\item{\\code{dbscan_min_pts} Minimum number of points required in the
          epsilon neighborhood for core points (including the core point
          itself). Defaults to 4.
        }
        \\item{\\code{max_var_tight_cluster} Maximum variance for an identified
          DBSCAN cluster to be considered 'tight-knit'. Defaults to 100.
        }
        \\item{\\code{max_prop_single_tight_cluster} Maximum proportion of
          points allowed to be within a single 'tight-knit' cluster (if a
          participant's data exceed this limit, they are classified as
          invalid). Defaults to 0.6.
        }
        \\item{\\code{safe_num_clusters} Minimum number of identified DBSCAN
          clusters (including 'noise' cluster) that guarantees validity of
          a participant's data if points are 'non-tight-knit'. Defaults to 4.
        }
        \\item{\\code{safe_twcv} Minimum total within-cluster variance (TWCV)
          score that guarantees a participant's data's validity if points are
          'non-tight-knit'. Defaults to 250.
        }
        \\item{\\code{symbol_filter} A character vector (or NULL) that specifies
          which graphemes' data to use. Defaults to NULL, meaning data from
          all of the participants' graphemes will be used.

      A data frame with columns

        classified as valid, FALSE for participants whose data were
        classified as invalid.}
        \\item{\\code{reason_invalid} Strings which describe for each
          participant why their data were deemed invalid. Participants
          whose data were classified as valid have empty strings here.
        }
        \\item{\\code{twcv} Numeric column which holds participants'
          calculated TWCV scores (NA for participants who had no/too
          few graphemes with complete responses).}
