#' @title Calculate Total Within Cluster Variance of 3D points
#'
#' @description Calculates \emph{Total Within Cluster Variance(TWCV)} of
#' 3D points.
#' @section TWCV:
#' TWCV is a synr-specific term for a measure that aims to describe spread
#' of points in 3D space while taking into account that points belong
#' to distinct clusters.
#' TWCV is calculated in a multi-step process:
#' \enumerate{
#'  \item Each cluster's centroid is calculated.
#'  \item All points' squared distances to their corresponding centroids are
#' calculated.
#'  \item The point-to-centroid squared distances are summed up.
#'  \item The sum of squared distances is divided by the total number
#' of points, minus the number of clusters (to account for decreased
#' degrees of freedom).
#' }

#' @param point_matrix An n-by-3 numerical matrix where each
#' row corresponds to a single point in 3D space.
#' @param cluster_vector A numerical vector of cluster assignments, of
#' length n (ie one assignment per point).
