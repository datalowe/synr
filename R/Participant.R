    Checks if this participant's data are valid based on passed arguments.
    This method aims to identify participants who had too few responses or
    varied their response colors too little, by marking them as invalid.
    Note that there are no absolutely correct values, as what is 'too little
    variation' is highly subjective. You might need to tweak parameters to be
    in line with your project's criteria, especially if you use another color
    space than CIELUV, since the default values are based on what seems
    to make sense in a CIELUV context. If you use the results in a
    research article, make sure to reference synr and specify what parameter
    values you passed to the function.

    This method relies heavily on the DBSCAN algorithm and the package
    'dbscan', and involves calculating a synr-specific 'Total Within-Cluster
    Variance' (TWCV) score. You can find more information, and
    what the parameters here mean, in
    the documentation for the function \\code{validate_get_twcv}.
    \\subsection{Parameters}{
      \\itemize{
        \\item{\\code{min_complete_graphemes} The minimum number of graphemes
          with complete (all non-NA color) responses that the participant data
          must have for them to not be categorized as invalid based on this
          criterion. Defaults to 7.
        }
        \\item{\\code{dbscan_eps} Radius of 'epsilon neighborhood' when applying
          DBSCAN clustering. Defaults to 30.
        }
        \\item{\\code{dbscan_min_pts} Minimum number of points required in the
          epsilon neighborhood for core points (including the core point
          itself). Defaults to 4.
        }
        \\item{\\code{max_var_tight_cluster} Maximum variance for an identified
          DBSCAN cluster to be considered 'tight-knit'. Defaults to 100.
        }
        \\item{\\code{max_prop_single_tight_cluster} Maximum proportion of
          points allowed to be within a single 'tight-knit' cluster (exceeding
          this leads to classification as invalid). Defaults to 0.6.
        }
        \\item{\\code{safe_num_clusters} Minimum number of identified DBSCAN
          clusters (including 'noise' cluster only if it consists of at least
          'dbscan_min_pts' points) that guarantees validity if
          points are 'non-tight-knit'. Defaults to 4.
        }
        \\item{\\code{safe_twcv} Minimum total within-cluster variance (TWCV)
          score that guarantees validity if points are 'non-tight-knit'.
          Defaults to 250.
        }
        \\item{\\code{complete_graphemes_only} A logical vector. If TRUE, 
          only data from graphemes that have all non-NA color responses
          are used; if FALSE, even data from graphemes with some NA color
          responses are used. Defaults to TRUE.
        }
        \\item{\\code{symbol_filter} A character vector (or NULL) that specifies
          which graphemes' data to use. Defaults to NULL, meaning data from
          all of the participant's graphemes will be used.
        }
      }

    \\subsection{Returns}{
      A list with components
      \\itemize{
        \\item{\\code{valid} TRUE if categorized as valid, otherwise FALSE.}
        \\item{\\code{reason_invalid} One-element character vector describing
          why participant's data were deemed invalid, or empty string if
          valid is TRUE.
        }
        \\item{\\code{twcv} One-element numeric (or NA if there are no/too few
          graphemes with complete responses) vector indicating participant's
          calculated TWCV.
        }
        \\item{\\code{num_clusters} One-element numeric (or NA if there are no/too few
          graphemes with complete responses) vector indicating
          the number of identified clusters counting toward the
          tally compared with 'safe_num_clusters'.
