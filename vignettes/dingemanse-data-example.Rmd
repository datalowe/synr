## Introduction
This is an example of how to use synr with actual data. For an in-depth tutorial which explains how synr works, including the functionality that comes up here, please see the [main tutorial](synr-tutorial.html).

The data used here are from a study by Cuskley, Dingemanse, van Leeuwen & Kirby (2019) and are available through [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/mdingemanse/colouredvowels). Note that the user (mdingemanse) who owns the repository is not involved in synr development, so please don't send questions about synr to him or other co-authors of the article.

The data are from an experiment where participants listened to 16 different recordings of spoken vowel sounds and responded with colors they experienced/associated with the vowels. You can find much more detail in the article and repository. In this tutorial, we'll assume that each of the recordings can be thought of as a single object, analogous to a grapheme. __Note__ that even though synr always refers to trial stimuli as 'graphemes' or 'symbols' (in order to make the documentation less abstract), you can apply synr to other types of consistency test data. Just remember that 'grapheme' then really means e. g. 'vowel sound' or whatever other type of stimuli are presented to participants.

## Load required libraries
We'll use `tidyr` to reformat the raw data, explained below, and `ggplot2` for producing custom plots. You should already have `ggplot2` installed since `synr` depends on it, but may you need to run `install.packages("tidyr")` to get `tidyr`.

```{r extra_libraries}
library(synr)
library(tidyr)
library(ggplot2)
```

## Download and reformat raw data
We'll first download the raw data from GitHub.
```{r download_data}
# download the 'coloured vowels' data
githuburl <- 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdingemanse/colouredvowels/master/BRM_colouredvowels_voweldata.csv'
dingemanse_voweldata <- read.csv(githuburl, sep=' ')
```

The downloaded data are in a 'one-row-per-stimulus' (vocal sound) format. synr needs the data to be in either 'long' or 'wide' format, as described in the article [Creating ParticipantGroup objects](synr-creategroup-with-long-format.html). Generally, 'long' format is preferred, so let's reformat the data to this.

```{r reformat_raw_data}
# 'pivot' the data into a long (one row per observation/trial) format,
# using tidyr's pivot_longer function (and the 'pipe' %>% operator)
cvow_long <- dingemanse_voweldata %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    cols=c('color1', 'color2', 'color3',
      'timing1', 'timing2', 'timing3'),
    names_to=c(".value", "trial"),
    names_pattern="(\\w*)(\\d)",
    values_to=c('color', 'timing')
  )
print(head(cvow_long))
```
## Roll up data into a ParticipantGroup object
Note that this might take a couple of minutes, since the data set is quite large.
```{r roll_up_data}
pg <- create_participantgroup(
  raw_df=cvow_long,
  n_trials_per_grapheme=3,
  id_col_name="anonid",
  symbol_col_name="item",
  color_col_name="color",
  time_col_name="timing",
  color_space_spec="Luv"
)
```
We use the L\*u\*v color space here, since that's what the article's authors used.

## Apply various synr functions

### Single participant plot
Let's produce a plot for the participant with ID "0086e9c0-418c-404c-8f3c-219de93cc3dc" (the raw data use anonymized ID's, which is why they are rather unwieldy).

```{r example_plot}
example_plot <- pg$participants[["0086e9c0-418c-404c-8f3c-219de93cc3dc"]]$get_plot(
  mean_line=TRUE,
  cutoff_line=TRUE,
  grapheme_size=4
)
# inspect the plot
example_plot
```

Remember that the 'grapheme' axis here is really a 'recording/vowel sounds' axis.

The participant appears to have provided valid responses with a fair bit of variation. Their mean consistency score (green line) was slightly above 200, far higher than the cutoff (blue line) of 135.30 that was suggested in Rothen, Seth, Witzel & Ward (2013) for the L\*u\*v color space.

Of course, it's not expected that most users will want to produce plots for all participants and look through them one by one. It can however be useful to look at a few of them to get a better feel for the data, or to inspect data more closely if something about a participant's responses seems off.

### Mean consistency scores
Here, we force a mean consistency score to be calculated even where participants have some (but not all) items with less than 3 valid color responses by specifying na.rm=TRUE. We specify that consistency scores should be calculated by using euclidean distances (synr uses euclidean distances by default, but it's specified here for extra clarity).

```{r calc_cons_scores}
mean_cons_scores <- pg$get_mean_consistency_scores( 
  method='euclidean',
  na.rm=TRUE
)
```

We'll also put the consistency scores in a data frame where scores are linked to their respective participant ID's:

```{r put_in_df}
participant_ids <- pg$get_ids()
cons_score_df <- data.frame(
  participant_id=participant_ids, 
  mean_cons_score=mean_cons_scores
)
print(head(cons_score_df))
```

### Number of graphemes with all-valid responses
Let's add information for each participant about the number of graphemes that they provided all-valid (3 non-NA, ie they correctly chose a color) responses for.

```{r add_num_valid}
num_valid <- pg$get_numbers_all_colored_graphemes()

cons_score_df[['num_allvalid_sounds']] <- num_valid
print(head(cons_score_df))
```
We might want to only include participants who had a minimum of 8 (50%) stimuli with all-valid responses, based on what the original article says:

> A total of 34 participants were removed from the sample because they chose "No color" for more than half of the items in the vowel association task, making it impossible to calculate a valid vowel consistency score.

```{r filter_valid_participants}
print(paste('number of participants before filtering:', nrow(cons_score_df)))

enough_responses_filter <- cons_score_df$num_allvalid_sounds >= 8
cons_score_df <- cons_score_df[enough_responses_filter, ]

print(paste('number of participants after filtering:', nrow(cons_score_df)))
```
It's not clear why there are seemingly more participants which fit the exclusion criteria in the data from GitHub compared to what is reported in the original article. (if you notice an error in this article, please write about it to datalowe@posteo.de)

### Validate participant data
synr includes a unique procedure for automatically classifying test data as valid or invalid, as explained in a specific [synr article](validate-data.html). Cuskley et al.'s article itself doesn't mention any validation procedure apart from excluding participants with too many "No color" responses, so we might try to apply very lenient criteria in order to only catch obviously invalid data, such as participants having used very similar colors (eg slightly different shades of black) for more than 80% of all their responses. Please see the [validation article](validate-data.html) for details about what's happening here.

```{r validate_participant_data}
validation_df <- pg$check_valid_get_twcv_scores(
  min_complete_graphemes = 8,
  dbscan_eps = 20,
  dbscan_min_pts = 4,
  max_var_tight_cluster = 150,
  max_prop_single_tight_cluster = 0.8,
  safe_num_clusters = 2,
  safe_twcv = 300
)

# again, use filter to only keep data from participants with
# >=8 all-valid responses graphemes
validation_df <- validation_df[enough_responses_filter, ]

cons_score_df[['data_valid']] <- validation_df$valid
cons_score_df[['reason_invalid']] <- validation_df$reason_invalid

# show only participants whose data were classified as invalid,
# and only relevant columns
cons_score_df[!cons_score_df$data_valid, c("participant_id", "mean_cons_score", "reason_invalid")]
```
All of the identified data sets that were classified by synr as invalid appear to have 80% or more of all responses be in roughly the same color. One of the participants, 'de916a2b-5041-4ecf-af86-4e11feaa5d4c', very clearly has invalid data even based on just their consistency score (0.034), as it is extremely low (due to having responded with black on all trials). What might be more interesting is to take a closer look at the participant with the highest consistency score (44.2), as their case might be somewhat less clear-cut.

```{r}
pg$participants[["d47c0e32-e3e2-4acf-84d0-08bf7375308b"]]$get_plot(
  grapheme_size=4
)
```

The participant has actually used what we might consider to be different colors, ie hues. Note however that their consistency score (44.2) means that they would be considered a synesthete, even though there is actually very little consistency in what hues are used for the different sounds, due to all colors being very light. For instance, the participant used a 'greyish', a 'brownish' and a 'bluish' color for the 12th grapheme/sound, but even the consistency score for this particular grapheme is well below the cutoff of 135.3. This means that even though one could argue that responses have fairly different hues, _at least in the context of consistency tests as they are currently commonly used and evaluated_, synr is correct in classifying the participant's data as invalid, ie having too little color variation.

It appears then that if synr were to be used in this manner, some misclassifications of participants as synesthetes could be prevented.

### Use synr-generated data with other libraries
Once data have been exported to a data frame, they can be used with other libraries as usual.

For example, we might be interested in the distribution of mean consistency scores.
```{r cons_score_pdf}
ggplot(cons_score_df, aes(x=mean_cons_score)) +  
  geom_density() +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 135.3, color="blue") +
  labs(x='Mean consistency score', y='Probability density')
```

```{r cons_score_ecdf}
ggplot(cons_score_df, aes(x=mean_cons_score)) +
  stat_ecdf(geom = "step") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 135.3, color="blue") +
  labs(x='Mean consistency score', y='Cumulative proportion of participants')
```

It appears that about 30% of all participants scored below the suggested cut-off of 135, as already reported by Cuskley et al.

## Summary
Much of the 'results' included here can already be found in the article by Cuskley et al. However, this article has hopefully given you an idea of how synr can be used with different types of data, and what role it fulfills.
