<p>When conducting consistency tests with participants, there might be
issues with their response patterns. A clear example of this is if a
participant responds with a red color in all but two trials of a
consistency test, like this:</p>
<p><img src="validate-data_files/figure-html/clearly_invalid-1.png" width="576"></p>
<p>This would lead to a very low (i. e. very consistent) consistency
score. Should this score, and the data, be considered valid? Most
synesthesia researchers would say no, and everyone would definitely say
no if the participant themselves don’t report that they associate the
color red with the stimuli used in the test.</p>
<p>Another instance of invalid data would be a participant who has
provided ‘no color’ (if a ‘no color’/‘null’/‘blank’ response alternative
is provided in the test) color responses for all but three graphemes.
Even if the participant would have used one color for each grapheme and
thus be very consistent, there’s a high risk that the participant simply
memorized their previous responses throughout the test since they would
have only had three graphemes to keep track of.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="clearly-valid-data">Clearly valid data<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#clearly-valid-data"></a>
</h3>
<p>A clear example of valid response data is if a participant has used
very different colors, like this:</p>
<p><img src="validate-data_files/figure-html/basic_individual_plot-1.png" width="576"></p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="possibly-invalid-data">Possibly invalid data<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#possibly-invalid-data"></a>
</h3>
<p>Many participants have response patterns that are harder to judge as
valid or invalid, such as participants who have:</p>
<ul>
<li>Used a red color for just 50% of all trials.</li>
<li>Used different shades of red and yellow for 90% of all trials.</li>
<li>Used black, white and blue for all trials.</li>
</ul>
<p>Should some or all of these be considered to be examples of invalid
data? Opinions are bound to differ.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="why-validate-summary">Why validate: summary<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#why-validate-summary"></a>
</h3>
<p>The basic issue is that participants might give responses that vary
too little in color for the consistency scores to mean anything. It is
of course at least theoretically possible that someone would truly only
have synesthetic associations with a single color. The consistency test,
however, cannot determine whether this is the case, or if the
participant for instance just likes the color red and keeps responding
with it since that’s the color that comes to mind if they don’t have a
stimulus-specific association.</p>

<h2 id="previously-used-validation-procedures">Previously used validation procedures<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#previously-used-validation-procedures"></a>
</h2>
<p>Different research studies have handled possibly invalid data
differently. Some (e.g. Cuskley et al., 2019) have opted for excluding
participants which respond with ‘no color’ for more than a certain
proportion of all trials. Others (Carmichael et al., 2015; Simner et
al., 2006) have opted for (also) excluding participants who respond with
‘the same color’ in too high a proportion of trials. Yet others have
excluded participants based on patterns that are more difficult to
systematically define, such as a pattern involving selecting “e.g. red
for ‘R’, green for ‘G’ and blue for ‘B’” (Carmichael et al., 2015).</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="data-validation-challenges">Data validation challenges<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#data-validation-challenges"></a>
</h3>
<p>Excluding participants based on the proportion or number of missing
and/or ‘no color’ responses is relatively straight-forward, though there
is currently no widely agreed upon threshold.</p>
<p>Excluding participants based on responses that do have an actual
color, but where there is too little ‘color variation’, raises difficult
questions which are briefly discussed below.</p>
<p>If using a criterion of allowing say only 60% of all responses to be
of the ‘same color’, how does one define boundaries of what a color is?
For instance, do teal, turquoise and cyan count as different colors? In
the image below, where would you say that the ‘blue’ graphemes end, and
the ‘blue-green’ graphemes start?</p>
<p><img src="validate-data_files/figure-html/bluegreen_plot-1.png" width="576"></p>
<p>Even if one is able to consistently define color boundaries, what if
a participant happens to respond with colors that are right at the
‘border’ of two color ranges? Relating back to the previous example, if
you’ve defined where ‘blue’ ends and ‘bluegreen’ starts, a participant
might give responses like this:</p>
<p><img src="validate-data_files/figure-html/bluegreen_color_2-1.png" width="576"></p>
<p>It might be reasonable to have placed the color border between ‘blue’
and ‘blue-green’ somewhere right around the middle of the above values.
If categorizing response colors based on these boundaries, then, the
participant would be considered to have 50% ‘blue’, and 50% ‘blue-green’
responses. But the color differences are so small, that a human observer
who doesn’t know anything about the color borders would probably say
that the participant has only responded with one color.</p>

<h3 id="simple-measures-of-spread">Simple measures of spread<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#simple-measures-of-spread"></a>
</h3>
<p>In order to get away from the arbitrariness of pre-defined ‘color
ranges’, as discussed above, one option would be to use a general
measurement of ‘spread’, similar to how we generally use variance and
standard deviation in statistics. One might consider response colors as
points in 3D color space, with e.g. axes ‘red’, ‘blue’ and ‘green’ (if
using RGB color space). An example of this can be seen in the
interactive graph below. Once you think of color data in this manner, it
makes sense to base measures of spread on the distances between color
points. A very simple approach might be to:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Calculate where the ‘middle’ (‘center of gravity’) of all points is
located. (in the interactive graph below, the ‘middle’ is marked with a
black point)</li>
<li>For each measured color point, calculate its distance from the
‘middle’.</li>
<li>Add up all these distances and divide by the total number of color
points.</li>
</ol>
<p>This would give a measure of spread based on the ‘mean distance from
center of gravity (midpoint)’. To achieve something more analogous to
variance as used with one-dimensional data, one may use <em>squared</em>
distances from the ‘middle’ in steps 2 and 3. If you’re interested in
the details of these calculations, see ‘More information’ at the end of
this article.</p>

problem with simple measures of spread is that they are very
sensitive to outliers and don’t take into account that responses might
be ‘grouped together’. For instance, consider a participant who has
given black color responses 80% of the time, and white color responses
the rest of the time. To a human observer, it would appear that the
participant has used a black color far too much for the data to say
anything. But simple measures of spread would indicate that the
participant response colors are very varied; since black and white are
extreme opposites, the ‘middle’ will end up quite far from both groups
of responses, and hence the (squared) distances will be long.</p>

<h3 id="clustering">Clustering<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#clustering"></a>
</h3>
<p>One way to take into account that there might be patterns to response
colors is to use so-called clustering (Jain, 2010). This is a general
statistical approach for identifying groups of data that belong together
and includes a number of specific methods, such as ‘k-means clustering’
and ‘Density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise’
(DBSCAN; Khan et al., 2014). DBSCAN is a good fit for grouping color
responses since it doesn’t make any assumptions about the shape or
number of clusters. See ‘More information’ at the end of this article to
find out more about DBSCAN itself.</p>
<p>To understand what clustering and specifically DBSCAN does with color
data, visualization helps. Let’s say a participant has a set of response
colors as described by this interactive graph:</p>

following clusters have been identified:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cluster 0: ‘noise’ cluster, which includes all points that weren’t
included in a specific cluster.</li>
<li>Cluster 1: white color responses (presented in dark blue).</li>
<li>Cluster 2: intensely red color responses (presented in a blue-green
color).</li>
<li>Cluster 3: black color responses (presented in green).</li>
<li>Cluster 4: red, but less intense, color responses (presented in a
yellow color).</li>
</ul>
<p>You might need to go back and forth a few times between the previous
two graphs for them to make sense.</p>
<p>We might agree with how DBSCAN clustered together ‘white’ (cluster 1)
and ‘black’ (cluster 3) color points, respectively. Depending on how you
perceive and define colors, you might agree or disagree with how the
‘red’ color points were grouped into two separate clusters. The point is
that using DBSCAN, one can be explicit about how color points should be
clustered together instead of relying on post-hoc subjective judgments
or arbitrary pre-defined ‘color borders’ as discussed earlier. How this
clustering happens is primarily determined by ‘epsilon’
(<code>eps</code>) and ‘minimum points in cluster’ (<code>minPts</code>)
parameters - see the ‘More information’ section.</p>
<p>DBSCAN on its own is however <em>not</em> sufficient for validating
color response data. The reason is that it doesn’t take into account
what happens ‘within’ clusters. A participant might vary their responses
so much that they all end up in the ‘noise’ cluster. Or, they might have
responses similar to what’s seen below:</p>

would consider all of the above points to form a single
cluster, since every single point has at least one ‘neighbor’ linking it
to the greater cluster. Granted, it’s unlikely that a participant will
respond in this particular manner, but the same phenomenon of fairly
spread out points being ‘chained together’ does happen in real data.
Thus, simply counting the number of clusters isn’t enough to be able to
determine the validity of color response data.</p>

<h3 id="combining-measure-of-spread-and-dbscan">Combining measure of spread and DBSCAN<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#combining-measure-of-spread-and-dbscan"></a>
</h3>
<p>In order to take into account all relevant information, synr uses an
approach for validating participant data that is based on combining
DBSCAN and the ‘variance-like’ measure of spread described earlier.</p>
<p>As part of the validation procedure, synr calculates <em>total
within-cluster variance</em> (TWCV). This is a modified measure of the
data’s total variance that takes into account clustering of data. You
can find details about this by reading the help documentation for the
synr <code>total_within_cluster_variance</code> function.</p>
<p>What follows is a rough overview of an example of synr’s validation
procedure being applied. It is assumed that participant data are from a
consistency test where each grapheme was presented for 3 trials. Many
aspects of the validation are specified by you as the user, but example
values (marked in bold) are used to make the example more concrete.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>If a participant has less than <strong>6</strong> graphemes with
complete color responses (3 color responses that aren’t of type
‘blank’/‘no color’), their data are directly classified as invalid.</li>
<li>Data from graphemes with non-complete color responses are filtered
away.</li>
<li>DBSCAN is applied to find clusters of color points in the ‘complete
grapheme’ data.</li>
<li>The ‘variance’ of each cluster is calculated.</li>
<li>The TWCV is calculated.</li>
<li>If a single low-variance cluster, ie a ‘tight-knit’ cluster,
includes more than <strong>60%</strong> of all color points, the
participant data are classified as invalid.</li>
</ol>
<p>Once steps 1-6 are cleared:</p>
<ul>
<li>If DBSCAN identified <strong>4</strong> or more clusters (roughly
meaning that 4 or more colors were each used for multiple responses),
the participant data are classified as valid.</li>
<li>If the TWCV score was <strong>250</strong> or more, the participant
data are classified as valid.</li>
</ul>
<p>In other words, if the participant data had few clusters,
<em>and</em> their TWCV score was below 250, they are classified as
invalid.</p>
<p>This approach enables invalidating data from participants who used
one or just a few colors too much, while still validating different
valid patterns of responding.</p>

<p>Note that the color space specification
(<code>color_space_spec</code>) will also affect synr’s validation
procedure. It is recommended that you use CIELUV (‘Luv’) or some other
color space that aims to be in line with human perception. You might
have noticed that RGB was used in the interactive graphs earlier as it’s
fairly intuitive, but it is <em>not</em> suitable for validation
procedures.</p>
<p>Now that you have a participantgroup, you want to use the
<code>check_valid_get_twcv_scores</code> method. This applies a
validation procedure, similar to the one outlined above, on a
per-participant basis for all participants in the group. The method’s

<p><strong>Parameters</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>min_complete_graphemes</code> The minimum number of graphemes
with complete (all non-NA color) responses that a participant’s data
must have for them to not be categorized as invalid based on this
criterion.</li>
<li>
<code>dbscan_eps</code> Radius of ‘epsilon neighborhood’ when
applying DBSCAN clustering.</li>
<li>
<code>dbscan_min_pts</code> Minimum number of points required in the
epsilon neighborhood for core points (including the core point itself)
when applying DBSCAN clustering.</li>
<li>
<code>max_var_tight_cluster</code> Maximum variance for an
identified DBSCAN cluster to be considered ‘tight-knit’.</li>
<li>
<code>max_prop_single_tight_cluster</code> Maximum proportion of
color points allowed to be within a single ‘tight-knit’ cluster (if a
participant’s data exceed this limit, they are classified as
invalid).</li>
<li>
<code>safe_num_clusters</code> Minimum number of identified DBSCAN
clusters (including the ‘noise’ cluster <em>if it consists of at least
<code>dbscan_min_pts</code> points</em>) that guarantees validity of a
participant’s data if points are ‘non-tight-knit’.</li>
<li>
<code>safe_twcv</code> Minimum total within-cluster variance (TWCV)
score that guarantees a participant’s data’s validity if points are
‘non-tight-knit’.</li>
<li>
<code>complete_graphemes_only</code> If TRUE, only data from
graphemes with complete sets of associated color responses are used for
clustering and variance calulations. If FALSE, even data from graphemes
with ‘incomplete’ response data are included.</li>
<li>
<code>symbol_filter</code> A character vector (or NULL) that
specifies which graphemes’ data to use. If NULL, data from all of the
participants’ graphemes (apart from filtering based on complete response
data) will be used.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Output</strong> A data frame with columns:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>valid</code> Holds TRUE for participants whose data were
classified as valid, FALSE for participants whose data were classified
as invalid.</li>
<li>
<code>reason_invalid</code> Strings which describe for each
participant why their data were deemed invalid. Participants whose data
were classified as valid have empty strings here.</li>
<li>
<code>twcv</code> Numeric column which holds participants’
calculated TWCV scores.</li>
<li>
<code>num_clusters</code> Numeric column which for each participant
holds the number of identified clusters (including the ‘noise’ cluster
<em>if it consists of at least <code>dbscan_min_pts</code>
points</em>).</li>
</ul>
<p>Note the <code>set.seed(1)</code> call. This is necessary for
replication. DBSCAN uses a partially random procedure for determining
clusters. In practice, when this has been tested by the main developer
(see below), the results have always been the same, but for some very
unusual sets of data the results might differ. Hence,
<code>set.seed(&lt;number&gt;)</code> should always be included in any
code you save/share, to be absolutely certain that
<code>check_valid_get_twcv_scores</code> will produce the same output if
run again.</p>
<p>Similar to other synr methods’ outputs, in order to tell which
classification goes with which participant, combine the output with
results from <code>get_ids</code>.</p>

validation<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#parameter-values-and-previous-applications-of-synrs-data-validation"></a>
</h3>
<p>The approach of using DBSCAN together with 3D ‘variance’ scores for
validation of consistency test data is, so far, unique to synr. Thus,
there are no norms regarding what particular values should be used.</p>
<p>The main developer of synr (Lowe Wilsson) has applied
<code>check_valid_get_twcv_scores</code> to a sample of consistency test
data from 268 participants with the exact values specified in the
example above, and then compared the results to independent
classifications by human raters. The data in the sample included digit
and letter graphemes, where each grapheme had been used in 3 trials.
Classifications were made separately for the digit and letter
categories.</p>
<p>The validity criteria used by human raters in the example sudy were
chiefly that participants needed to have at least 4 graphemes with
‘complete responses’ (ie 3 non-‘blank’ color responses) in the category
being considered, that they used at least three different colors (eg
yellow, red, orange), and that they didn’t use the same color for more
than 60% of all responses.</p>
<p>When classifications produced by synr were compared with those of
human raters, there was agreement for all but a handful of participants.
In most of these cases, it turned out that the human raters had missed
some detail, eg participants who had used the same color for just over
60% of all responses had been erroneously classified as valid. In one
case, a participant had responded with different shades of red that were
somewhat close to orange, leading to a disagreement among the human
raters. In the end, after discussion the consensus was that synr’s
classifications were the most accurate in all cases.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#summary"></a>
</h2>
<p>synr uses a novel approach for validating participant data which
shows great promise. It is likely to reduce time spent on manually
sorting through consistency test data. Most of all, it lets researchers
clearly specify and operationalize valid data criteria. The procedure
involves more abstract concepts like ‘total within-cluster variance’,
but has the benefit of not having to rely on diffuse concepts like
‘number of colors’.</p>
<p>Note that a synr ‘invalid’ classification essentially means that it’s
inappropriate to simply feed the data into consistency scoring
algorithms. It’s up to users to decide how to handle participants with
‘invalid’ data, eg by excluding them from analyses entirely or
considering them as non-synesthetes.</p>
<p>Some response patterns only make sense to humans and cannot be picked
up by DBSCAN. An example is using an __o__range color for the grapheme
‘O’, which was found in one study (Simner et al., 2006) to be more
frequent among self-reported non-synesthetes with low consistency scores
than among self-reported synesthetes. If validity assessments are to
take these very subjective patterns into account (as done in e. g.
Carmichael et al., 2015), synr needs to be complemented by human
ratings.</p>
<p>If synr is used for data validation then <strong>please reference
synr</strong> itself (for now, <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=synr" class="external-link uri">https://cran.r-project.org/package=synr</a>) and include
code and/or values you passed to
<code>check_valid_get_twcv_scores</code> when reporting results. It’s
also important to avoid post-hoc definitions of validation criteria.
Thus, if it’s feasible, <strong>please decide before starting data
collection, or based on a smaller initial sample, what values to use
with <code>check_valid_get_twcv_scores</code></strong>.</p>

<p>More details about data validation-related procedures can be found in
synr’s documentation for the following functions (access the
documentation by running
e.g. <code><a href="../reference/centroid_3d_sq_dist.html">?synr::centroid_3d_sq_dist</a></code>):</p>
<ul>
<li><code>centroid_3d_sq_dist</code></li>
<li><code>total_within_cluster_variance</code></li>
<li><code>validate_get_twcv</code></li>
</ul>
<p>You can also find higher-level information in the documentation for
the <code>check_valid_get_twcv_scores</code> method by running
<code><a href="../reference/ParticipantGroup-class.html">?synr::ParticipantGroup</a></code>.</p>
